# NewsAppStage2
News App. Stage 2 Project from course ABND by Google in Udacity. 

The goal is to add a Settings Screen to the News Feed app you made earlier in Part 1 which will allow users to narrow down the stories displayed in from the feed.

This project is about combining various ideas and skills weâ€™ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

- Implement the Preference Fragment
- Launch a Settings Activity from a menu in the Main Activity
- Use Uri.Builder class to add query parameters to the URL
- Update and display the Preference Summary
